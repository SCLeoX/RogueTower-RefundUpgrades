# Refund Upgrades
This is a mod for [Rogue Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843760/Rogue_Tower/). It allows the player to refund purchased upgrades one-at-a-time.

To refund an upgrade, simply click on it. Once refunded, all XP previously spent on that upgrade will be returned. Refunding an upgrade will also automatically refund its subsequent upgrades.

In addition, if the number of unlocked cards after refunding dropped below the requirement for certain upgrades (e.g. the upgrade that allows you to draw cards more frequently), that upgrade will also be automatically refunded.

## Installation
1. [Install BepInEx](https://rogue-tower.thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInEx_Rogue_Tower/).
2. Run the game and exit to create the required directory structure.
3. Download this mod and extract RefundUpgrades.dll into `<Rogue Tower installation location>/BepInEx/plugins`.
4. Enjoy

Alternatively, you might be able to install this mod with [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://thunderstore.io/). I have not tested it. Let me know if it doesn't work.
